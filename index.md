# Darshon E Maa Er Dorshon
Being the first of the ten [Mahavidyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavidya), [Maa Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali) is the epitome of [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti). _Her_ iconography depicts _Her_ as "ugra" (fierce) - dark as the darkest [Kartik Amavasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavasya) night sky, with three wide-open eyes that see past time, long tangled hair, a lolling crimson tongue, and a garland of countless skulls symbolizing the passing of time - innumerable births and deaths (*Kaal*). _She_ stands on [Lord Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), in the cremation ground (*samshan*). In _Her_ left hands, _She_ holds a severed head and a *kharga* (scimitar), symbols of the destruction of [Ahamkara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahamkara) (ego, the “I” consciousness) and [Avidya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Hinduism)) (ignorance). In _Her_ right hands, _She_ blesses and grants boons through the [Abhaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhayamudra) and [Varada mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadamudra).
Despite this fierce iconography, we love and adore _Her_ in our own ways. For example, my sister, looking at our community's (*para*) Kali idol (*murti*), exclaimed, “Maa ke khub cute dekhte lagche” (Maa looks so cute). That's the magic of Kali - terrifying yet tender, destructive yet deeply loving.

_But who really is Maa Kali? What does She signify? **How can we see Her as Thakur Sri Ramakrishna saw Her?**_  
Let's take a journey together - to see Maa as the Mother, as Power, as the Primordial Energy, and as the Self within, each revealing a different facet of the same truth. Understanding each, we discover that how we see Maa depends on our *Bhava* - the inner feeling with which we approach Her.

# Bhava 1: Kali as the Divine Mother {#aspect-1}
At this level, Shakti appears in the form of Maa Kali, Maa Durga, Maa Saraswati, or any motherly power we worship. _She_ is external to us, our divine protector, our guide, our nurturer. We call out to _Her_ as we would to our earthly mother. Sometimes in love, sometimes in fear, but always in faith. _She_ destroys evil and removes obstacles, yet her destruction is compassionate, which clears the path for light to enter. _She_ blesses those who walk the path of [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), and gently corrects those who stray. Understanding _Her_ in this way is [Bhakti Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), the path of devotion. Here, the devotee and the Divine are two separate beings bound by love. It's a relationship of sweetness, surrender, and emotion - a [_Rasa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(theology)) (flavour) that fills the heart with bliss.

# Bhava 2: Kali as Shakti - The Power of Shiva {#aspect-2}
At a deeper level, Maa Kali is not merely someone outside who blesses us; _She_ is the very Power of the Absolute (Shiva). _She_ is Shiva's ardhangini - _His_ other half, _His_ pulse. Without _Her_, Shiva is _sava_ - motionless, pure stillness without expression. _She_ is _His_ expressive power, the one who makes consciousness move. As mentioned in the 6th mantra of the [Devi Sukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta) ([Ṛgveda: X.125](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)):

> **ahaṃ rudrāya dhanurā tanomi brahmadviṣe śarave hantavā u, ahaṃ janāya samadaṃ kṛṇomy-ahaṃ dyāvā-pṛthivī āviveśa ॥** 6
>_(Meaning: I bend the bow for Rudra to slay the demonic enemies of the noble. I battle the enemies of my devotees. Indeed, I pervade heaven and earth.)_

This is [Tantric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra) [non-duality philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism) (Shiva-Shakti tattva philosophy), where Shiva is pure, unchanging consciousness (Cit), and Shakti is the vibration, the movement (Spanda) of that consciousness. Together they form existence itself - the stillness and the dance. When Maa Kali dances, the universe comes alive; when _She_ stops, everything returns to stillness. Every breath, every heartbeat, every flash of thought is her movement within the vast silence of Shiva. In the Kali Tantra and Sakta texts, this union is described as a constant embrace, where Shiva, lying below, symbolizes the silent foundation of awareness, while Kali, standing upon _Him_, symbolizes energy rising and playing upon that awareness. When we recognize this, the image of Kali standing on Shiva is no longer "violent" but profoundly symbolic: consciousness and energy - two names for one Reality, forever entwined.

# Bhava 3: Kali as the Primordial Power that Flows through Us {#aspect-3}

At this level, Kali is no longer just an external goddess or even the power of Shiva. _She_ is the primordial pulse that keeps the universe alive. Shakti is the unseen rhythm of existence, the force by which the unmanifest becomes manifest. The rising sun, the beating of your heart, the birth and death of stars - all dance to _Her_ rhythm. The same energy that spins galaxies also hums within your spine as [Prana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana). Every thought that flashes across your mind, every surge of emotion, every act of creation or destruction - all are movements of Shakti. _She_ is the power that makes perception possible, the background vibration that turns pure consciousness into experience. When you feel inspired, when you love deeply, when you suffer and still rise again - that's _Her_ too. Shakti is not "out there"; _She_ is the current that flows through everything that is. According to [Samkhya Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya), _She_ is Mūla-Prakṛti, the first cause. In [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), _She_ is [Maya-Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Hinduism), the dynamic nature of [Nirguna Brahman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrf6pbk/revision/2) - pure stillness appearing as motion. Kali is that very motion - timeless energy taking form as time itself. As mentioned in the 4th and 8th mantras of the Devi Sukta (Ṛgveda: X.125):
> **mayā so annam-atti yo vipaśyati yaḥ prāṇiti ya īṃ śṛṇotyuktam, amantavo māṃ ta upa kṣiyanti śrudhi-śruta śraddhivaṃ te vadāmi ॥** 4
>_(Meaning: He who eats food, sees, breathes, and hears that is spoken, does so through me. Those who are ignorant of me perish. You, who have ears, listen - I tell you that which is deserving of Śraddhā.)_
>
> **aham-eva vāta-iva pra vāmy-ārabhamāṇā bhuvanāni viśvā, paro divā para enā pṛthivyaitāvatī mahinā saṃ babhūva ॥** 8
> _(Meaning: Like the wind that blows, I set in motion all the created things. I am beyond the sky and the earth and I have become all this, in my own splendour.)_

# Bhava 4: Kali as Your Inner Being {#aspect-4}
Now come close. Ask yourself the question **"Who am I?"** Are you the body? The mind? If so, then point me to where in the body "you" reside? You might point towards your head and say, _"Here, in the brain"_. But, if I take an MRI of your brain, will I find you sitting there? No, right? The body is a tool, an instrument. The atma is subtler.

Then maybe you will say, _"I am the mind - my thoughts, feelings, memories"_. But think again. In deep sleep, the mind goes silent, and yet you remain! You wake and say, "I slept well". Someone clearly witnessed even that blankness. Or perhaps you will say, _"I am the social roles I play - as a parent, a child, a doctor, a friend, etc."_ - an idea which resonates among many cognitive scientists. But roles change every day. The daughter becomes a mother, the student becomes a teacher, the employee becomes the boss. Your knowledge, emotions, preferences, even your opinions, evolve with time - yet something constant watches it all. Who keeps track of all these changes? Who says, "I was different before"? That quiet witness - that awareness which notes change - is the real you.

Let's understand it deeper. If you observe the mind carefully in meditation, you will see thoughts rise and fall, emotions come and go, and even the feeling of "I" fades and returns. During moments of deep focus, such as reading, painting, or even watching a film, you forget time, body, and surroundings. Yet afterward, you know you were absorbed. That knowing is proof of the silent Witness - the [Sakshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakshi_(witness)) that never sleeps. This Witness has no shape, no boundary, no birth. It is pure Awareness - [Sat-Cit-Ananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccid%C4%81nanda), the essence of [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). At this level, Shiva and Shakti merge. Stillness and movement, energy and consciousness, they are not two - they are Advaita. Like wave and ocean, they differ only in name and form (nama and rupa).

**What is Brahman?**

Brahman is not a "cosmic thing". _It_ cannot be objectified, because _It_ is the very ground of knowing. Our language inevitably treats _It_ as an object, but _It_ is that by which even language shines. That's why the sages used the method of ["Neti Neti"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_neti) (not this, not that) to point beyond words. Whatever you can describe is already within the light of Brahman. As [Swami Sarvapriyananda](https://www.vedantany.org/introductory-lectures) beautifully says, _"The subject can never be the object of experience"_. It's like [Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) in spiritual form: within any system, there are truths that the system itself cannot prove. Likewise, within this finite body-mind system, we can't "know" Brahman as an object - because Brahman is the subject and this body-mind system is the object.

You might dejectedly wonder, **"Then can I never experience Brahman?"**

The paradox is, you already are experiencing _It_, always. Because, as the [Chandogya Upanishad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandogya_Upanishad) mentions, you are _It_. [**Tat tvam asi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas) - You are That. Just as you infer the presence of light from the objects it reveals, you can infer Brahman from the very fact that you see, think, and feel. Objects in a room are not visible in the absence of light. Hence, seeing the objects is evidence of the presence of the illuminating light. Similarly, this entire existence is lit by That Consciousness. Every dream, every silence, every moment of awareness, every experience of yours is _Its_ evidence. Even the question "Can I experience Brahman?" arises within _Its_ light. Just like the ocean and its waves are nothing but water, you and Shakti are nothing but manifestations of Brahman.

This is the unchanging truth that death cannot touch. Your body will die, your mind and the sense of "I" will dissolve, but your Swarupa (your true essence) is eternal. It is infinite, unborn, and deathless. As Sri Krishna declares in the [Bhagavad Gita](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/index/) (2.17-2.25): the Self is indestructible; weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it.

> **avināśhi tu tadviddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam, vināśham avyayasyāsya na kaśhchit kartum arhati ॥** (2.17)
> 
> **antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śharīriṇaḥ, anāśhino ’prameyasya tasmād yudhyasva bhārata ॥** (2.18)
> 
> **ya enaṁ vetti hantāraṁ yaśh chainaṁ manyate hatam, ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate ॥** (2.19)
> 
> **na jāyate mriyate vā kadāchin, nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ, ajo nityaḥ śhāśhvato ’yaṁ purāṇo, na hanyate hanyamāne śharīre ॥** (2.20)
>
> **nainaṁ chhindanti śhastrāṇi nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ, na chainaṁ kledayantyāpo na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ ॥** (2.23)
>
> **achchhedyo ’yam adāhyo ’yam akledyo ’śhoṣhya eva cha, nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇur achalo ’yaṁ sanātanaḥ ॥** (2.24)
>
> **avyakto ’yam achintyo ’yam avikāryo ’yam uchyate, tasmādevaṁ viditvainaṁ nānuśhochitum arhasi ॥** (2.25)

So yes - **you are Shakti**, but not in the egoic sense of possessing power.
> You don't "have" Shakti; you are Shakti - localized for a while in this body, yet never limited by it.

When that insight dawns, all comparison dissolves. You no longer see "yourself" and "others"; you see Maa everywhere - the same infinite, ever-living consciousness shining as every form. You realize **Chidanada roopah Shivoham Shivoham**, as nicely sung in [Nirvana Shatakam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed_RsCvuPBQ&list=RDEd_RsCvuPBQ&start_radio=1)

# Conclusion
And thus, the journey completes. From worshipping _Her_ outside, to finding _Her_ within, to finally dissolving as _Her_. It's alright if we can't always "find" the Mother. She is Anondomoyee - ever-blissful, ever-revealing. She appears in whatever form you are ready to see. And if you truly long for Her, She will take the shape of your longing. As Thakur said, "Joto mot, toto poth" (As many faiths, so many paths). Truly, each heart has its own path to the Mother, and She expresses _Herself_ in each life in a unique way.

But here lies the real difficulty. Once the days of the festival pass, we tend to forget _Her_. "Life" rushes back in - work, family, deadlines, responsibilities. We become busy again: busy chasing science, progress, and success; busy offering our minds to the pleasures of the senses; busy living what we call "real life", while treating the philosophical side of life as mere theory - something to be discussed idly over a cup of tea (aantlami), but never actually lived. And in that busyness, the Mother becomes a faint memory - a quiet presence tucked away in some forgotten corner of the heart.

To truly find _Her_ again, we must, even for a moment, set aside these toys of worldly life and rekindle that yearning - that sacred restlessness (byakulata). As Thakur said, we must abandon our toys and call out for the Mother, just as a child cries only for Ma and is pacified by nothing else - not even their favorite playthings. Without that yearning, we remain content with the fleeting pleasures of a fleeting world, never truly happy, never truly fulfilled. Look around you - can you find a single person who says, "Yes, I am perfectly happy with my life. I want nothing more, no further achievement, no added comfort or pleasure."?

But when that longing for the Mother awakens, even for a single moment, you realize that _She_ was never gone. _She_ was there all along - in your breath, in your gaze, in your moments of joy and sorrow, in that silent awareness within you - the **Jyotir-o-Jyoti**.

    এই বছর আমাদের প্রার্থনা খুবই সহজ। <strong>মা</strong> যেন আমাদের জীবনে প্রবেশ করে আমাদের <em>জ্ঞানার্জনের</em> পথ দেখায়। আমরা যেন মায়ের উপস্থিতি সর্বদা অনুভব করতে পারি। তাঁর উপস্থিতিতে প্রতিটি মুহূর্ত সম্পূর্ণ নিমগ্ন হয়ে বাঁচার পথে আমাদেরকে পথনির্দেশ করার জন্য নীচে আমরা একটি ছোট্ট প্রবন্ধ লিখেছি। মা কালী ও তাঁর নানান রূপ নিয়ে হৃদয়ের নিবেদন। পড়ে দেখবেন, এবং আপনার হৃদয় যে রূপ চায়, সেই রূপেই যেন <strong>মা</strong> ধরা দেন। <strong>জয় মা!</strong>

# মায়ের দার্শনিক দর্শন
দশ [মহাবিদ্যার](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavidya) প্রথম মহাবিদ্যা [মা কালী](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali)। তিনি শক্তিরূপিণী। উগ্র তাঁর রূপ। তাঁর গায়ের রঙ কার্তিকী অমাবস্যার গভীর অন্ধকারের থেকেও কালো। তিনি ত্রিনয়নী - সময়-কাল-এর ঊর্ধ্বে। তাঁর জটার মতো লম্বা চুল, লাল জিহ্বা, আর গলায় অসংখ্য খুলি দিয়ে গাঁথা মালা, যা অনন্ত জন্ম আর মৃত্যু (কাল)-এর প্রতীক। তিনি স্বয়ং পশুপতির বুকে শ্মশানে বিরাজমান। তাঁর বাঁ হাতে কাটা মুণ্ডু আর খড়্গ - [অহংকার](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahamkara) আর [অবিদ্যার](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Hinduism)) বিনাশের প্রতীক। তিনি এক ডান হাতে আশ্বাস দিচ্ছেন [অভয় মুদ্রায়](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhayamudra), আবার আর এক ডান হাতে বরদান দিচ্ছেন [বরদা মুদ্রায়](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadamudra)।
এই উগ্র রূপ হওয়া সত্ত্বেও আমরা ভয় না পেয়ে মাকে নিজ নিজ ভাবে স্নেহ করি আর ভালোবাসি। এই আগের দিন বোন পাড়ার কালীমূর্তি দেখে বলল, “মা-কে খুব কিউট দেখতে লাগছে।” এরকম অদ্ভুতই মায়ের টান - তিনি উগ্র হয়েও স্নেহময়ী।

তবে মা কালী কে? তিনি কিসের প্রতীক? **তাঁকে আমরা কীভাবে দেখতে পারি, ঠিক যেমন ঠাকুর রামকৃষ্ণ সবসময় দেখতেন?**
চলুন একসাথে এক যাত্রায়, যেখানে মাকে আমরা চার রূপে দেখব - মাতারূপে, শক্তিরূপে, আদ্যশক্তিরূপে, আর আমাদের অন্তঃসত্তারূপে। ঠিক যেমন ঠাকুর রামকৃষ্ণ বলেছেন, _"যত মত, তত পথ।"_ তেমনি প্রতিটি রূপ মা-কে দেখার নানা পথ। আমাদের ভাবানুযায়ী যে রূপে চাই, আমরা মাকে সর্বদাই দেখতে পারি।

# ভাব ১: দিব্য জননী {#aspect-1}
শক্তি প্রকাশিত হন মা কালী, মা দুর্গা, মা সরস্বতী এবং নানান মাতৃশক্তিরূপে। তিনি আমাদের সৃষ্টি করেছেন, বিপদ থেকে রক্ষা করেন, আমাদের ভালো রাখেন। যেমন আমরা জন্মদাত্রী মাকে ডাকি, তেমনি শক্তিরূপে মাকেও ডাকি - ভালো-খারাপ দু’সময়েই। তিনি অধর্মের নাশ করেন, বাধা সরান, আমাদের [ধর্মের](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma) পথে চলতে শেখান। আর যখন আমরা অধর্মের দিকে ঝুঁকে পড়ি, তিনি মমতা-সহ আমাদের সংশোধন করেন। মাকে এই রূপে দেখা-ই [ভক্তিযোগ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga) - মাধুর্য, স্নেহ ও আন্তরিকতায় ভরা।

# ভাব ২: শিবের সচল শক্তি {#aspect-2}
আরও গভীরে গেলে মা কালী কেবল বাহিরের কোনো সত্তা নন; _তিনি_ **পরম সত্যের শক্তি (শিব)**। _তিনি_ শিবের *অর্ধাঙ্গিনী* - তাঁর স্পন্দন। শক্তি ছাড়া শিব *শব* - নিস্তরঙ্গ চৈতন্য। _তিনি_ সেই প্রকাশশক্তি, যিনি চৈতন্যকে গতিময় করেন। [দেবীসূক্ত](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta) (ঋগ্বেদ ১০.১২৫) বলে:

> **ahaṃ rudrāya dhanurā tanomi brahmadviṣe śarave hantavā u, ahaṃ janāya samadaṃ kṛṇomy-ahaṃ dyāvā-pṛthivī āviveśa ॥** 6
>
> _(অর্থ: আমি রুদ্রের ধনুক টানি… আকাশ-পাতাল ভেদ করে আমি বিরাজমান।)_

এটাই [তন্ত্র](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra)-র **শিব–শক্তি তত্ত্ব**: শিব = চিত্ (নির্বিকার চৈতন্য), শক্তি = স্পন্দ (চৈতন্যের আন্দোলন)। দু’য়ে মিলে সৃষ্টিস্বরূপ - *নিঃস্তব্ধতা ও নৃত্য*। কালী নৃত্য করলে বিশ্ব জেগে ওঠে; থামলে সব নিস্তব্ধ। প্রতিটি নিঃশ্বাস, হৃদস্পন্দন, চিন্তার ঝলক - শিবের নিস্তব্ধতায় মায়েরই নৃত্য। তাই শিব-বক্ষে কালীমূর্তি কোনো হিংসা নয় - গভীর প্রতীক: চৈতন্য ও শক্তি - এক সত্যের দুই নাম।

# ভাব ৩: আদ্যশক্তি {#aspect-3}
এই স্তরে, কালী আর কেবল বাহিরের কোনো দেবী নন, এমনকি শিবের শক্তি হিসেবেও সীমাবদ্ধ নন। _তিনি_ হলেন সেই আদ্য-স্পন্দন, যা মহাবিশ্বকে জীবন্ত রাখে। শক্তি হল অস্তিত্বের অদৃশ্য ছন্দ-যার বলে অপ্রকাশ্য প্রকাশিত হয়। উদীয়মান সূর্য, তোমার হৃদয়ের স্পন্দন, নক্ষত্রের জন্ম ও মৃত্যু-সবই _তাঁর_ তালে নাচে। যে শক্তি গ্যালাক্সি ঘোরায়, সেই শক্তিই তোমার মেরুদণ্ডে [প্রাণ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana) হয়ে সুর তোলে। তোমার মনে যে চিন্তা ক্ষণিক ঝলকে ওঠে, যে আবেগ ঢেউ তোলে, সৃষ্টি বা বিনাশের প্রতিটি ক্রিয়া-সবই শক্তিরই গতি। _তিনি_ হলেন সেই শক্তি, যার ফলে উপলব্ধি সম্ভব; সেই পটভূমির কম্পন, যা নির্মল চৈতন্যকে অভিজ্ঞতায় রূপ দেয়। তুমি যখন অনুপ্রাণিত হও, গভীরভাবে ভালোবাসো, কষ্ট পেয়েও আবার উঠে দাঁড়াও-সেটাও _তাঁর_ই প্রকাশ। শক্তি কোথাও “বাইরে” নয়; _তিনি_ হলেন সেই স্রোত, যা যা-কিছু আছে, তার ভেতর দিয়েই প্রবাহিত। [সাংখ্য দর্শন](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya) মতে, _তিনি_ মূলপ্রকৃতি (মূল কারণ)। [অদ্বৈত বেদান্ত](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta)-এ _তিনি_ [মায়া-শক্তি](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Hinduism)-[নির্গুণ ব্রহ্ম](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrf6pbk/revision/2)-এর গতিশীল প্রকৃতি; স্থির নীরবতা যেখানে গতি হয়ে প্রকাশ পায়। কালী সেই গতি-ই-কালাতীত শক্তি, যা নিজেই “সময়” রূপ ধারণ করে। যেমন **দেবীসূক্তের** (ঋগ্বেদ: ১০.১২৫) ৪র্থ ও ৮ম মন্ত্রে বলা হয়েছে:
> **mayā so annam-atti yo vipaśyati yaḥ prāṇiti ya īṃ śṛṇotyuktam, amantavo māṃ ta upa kṣiyanti śrudhi-śruta śraddhivaṃ te vadāmi ॥** 4
> 
> _(অর্থ: যে আহার করে, যে দেখে, যে শ্বাস নেয়, এবং যে উচ্চারিত বাক্য শোনে-সে সবই আমার (শক্তি) দ্বারাই করে। যারা আমার সম্বন্ধে অজ্ঞ, তারা নাশপ্রাপ্ত হয়। হে কর্ণবান, শোন-আমি তোমাদের সেই কথাই বলি, যা শ্রদ্ধার যোগ্য।)_
>
> **aham-eva vāta-iva pra vāmy-ārabhamāṇā bhuvanāni viśvā, paro divā para enā pṛthivyaitāvatī mahinā saṃ babhūva ॥** 8
> 
> _(অর্থ: বয়ে যাওয়া বাতাসের মতো আমি (শক্তি) সব সৃষ্ট বস্তুকে গতি দিই। আমি আকাশ ও পৃথিবীর অতীত; নিজের মহিমায় আমি এ-সবই হয়ে উঠেছি।)_

# ভাব ৪: অন্তরের আমি {#aspect-4}

এবার একটু কাছে এসো। নিজেকে জিজ্ঞেস করো-**“আমি কে?”** তুমি কি শরীর? নাকি মন? যদি তাই হয়, তবে দেহের ঠিক কোথায় “তুমি” বসবাস করো দেখিয়ে দাও। তুমি হয়তো মাথার দিকে ইঙ্গিত করে বলবে, _“এখানে, মস্তিষ্কে।”_ কিন্তু আমি যদি তোমার মস্তিষ্কের এম‌آর-আই করি, সেখানে কি বসে থাকা “তোমাকে” পাব? না, তাই তো? শরীর হল এক যন্ত্র, এক উপকরণ। আত্মা আরও সূক্ষ্ম।

তারপর তুমি হয়তো বলবে, _“আমি মন-আমার ভাবনা, অনুভূতি, স্মৃতি।”_ কিন্তু আবার ভাবো। গভীর নিদ্রায় মন স্তব্ধ হয়ে যায়, তবু তুমি তো থাকো! ঘুম থেকে উঠে বলো, “ভালো ঘুম হয়েছে।” অর্থাৎ সেই শূন্যতাকেও কেউ প্রত্যক্ষ করেছে। অথবা তুমি বলবে, _“আমি সমাজে যে ভূমিকাগুলো পালন করি-অভিভাবক, সন্তান, চিকিৎসক, বন্ধু ইত্যাদি”-_ যা অনেক কগনিটিভ সায়েন্টিস্টের ভাবনার সঙ্গেও মেলে। কিন্তু ভূমিকা প্রতিদিন বদলায়-কন্যা মা হয়, ছাত্র শিক্ষক হয়, কর্মী প্রভু হয়। তোমার জ্ঞান, আবেগ, পছন্দ-অপছন্দ, এমনকি মতও সময়ে সময়ে রূপ বদলায়-তবু এক স্থির সত্তা সবকিছু লক্ষ্য করে যায়। এই পরিবর্তনের হিসাব কে রাখে? কে বলে, “আমি আগে অন্যরকম ছিলাম”? যে নীরব প্রত্যক্ষদর্শী-যে সচেতনতা পরিবর্তনকে টের পায়-সেই-ই আসল তুমি।

আরও গভীরে যাই। ধ্যানে মনকে নিবিড়ভাবে দেখলে বোঝো-ভাবনা ওঠে-নামে, আবেগ আসে-যায়, এমনকি “আমি”-বোধটাও মিলিয়ে আবার ফিরে আসে। একাগ্রতার মুহূর্তে-পড়তে, আঁকতে, বা সিনেমা দেখতে-সময়, দেহ, চারপাশ ভুলে যাও। তবু পরে _জানো_ তুমি ডুবে ছিলে। এই জানা-ই সেই নীরব প্রত্যক্ষদর্শীর প্রমাণ-[সাক্ষী](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakshi_(witness))-যে কখনও ঘুমোয় না। সাক্ষীর আকার নেই, সীমানা নেই, জন্ম নেই। তিনি নির্মল সচেতনতা-[সৎ–চিত্–আনন্দ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccid%C4%81nanda)-[ব্রহ্ম](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)-এরই সারতত্ত্ব। এই স্তরে শিব ও শক্তি অবিভেদ্য-স্থিতি ও গতি, শক্তি ও চৈতন্য-দুটি নয়, **অদ্বৈত**। ঢেউ ও সাগর যেমন জলে এক, তেমনি নাম ও রূপে মাত্র ভেদ।

**ব্রহ্ম কী?**

ব্রহ্ম কোনো “জাগতিক বস্তু” নয়। _তাকে_ বস্তু করা যায় না, কারণ _তাই_ জানা-চেনার অবলম্বন। ভাষা অনিবার্যভাবে _তাকে_ বস্তুর মতো ধরতে চায়, অথচ _সেই_ আলোর মধ্যেই তো ভাষাও দীপ্যমান। তাই ঋষিরা ["নেতি নেতি"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_neti)-“এ নয়, সে নয়”-পদ্ধতি নিয়েছেন, ভাষার অতীতের দিকে ইঙ্গিত করতে। যা কিছু বর্ণনা করা যায়, তা-ই ইতিমধ্যে ব্রহ্ম-দীপ্ত। যেমন [স্বামী সর্বপ্রিয়ানন্দ](https://www.vedantany.org/introductory-lectures) সুন্দর করে বলেন, _“বিষয় কখনোই অভিজ্ঞতার বস্তু হতে পারে না।”_ আধ্যাত্মিক ক্ষেত্রে এটা [গ্যোডেলের অসম্পূর্ণতা-সূত্র](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)-এর মতো: যে কোনো সিস্টেমের ভিতরে এমন সত্য থাকে যা সেই সিস্টেম দিয়ে প্রমাণসাধ্য নয়। তেমনই, এই সীমিত দেহ–মনের ভিতর থেকে আমরা ব্রহ্মকে “বস্তু” করে জানতে পারি না-কারণ ব্রহ্মই তো বিষয়, আর দেহ–মন বস্তু।

তুমি হয়তো হতাশ হয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করবে, **“তাহলে কি আমি কখনোই ব্রহ্মকে অভিজ্ঞ করতে পারব না?”**

বিরোধাভাস এই যে, তুমি তো সর্বক্ষণই _তাকে_ অভিজ্ঞ করছ। কারণ [ছান্দোগ্য উপনিষদ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandogya_Upanishad) বলছে-তুমিই _সে_। [**তত্ ত্বাম অসি**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas) - “তুই সেই।” যেমন আলোকিত বস্তুকে দেখে আলোর অস্তিত্ব ধরা পড়ে, তেমনি দেখা–ভাবা–অনুভব-এই যে চৈতন্যময়তা-এগুলো থেকেই ব্রহ্মের প্রমাণ মেলে। আলো না থাকলে ঘরের জিনিসপত্রই তো দৃশ্যমান নয়; সুতরাং বস্তু দেখা-ই আলোর উপস্থিতির প্রমাণ। তেমনি এই সমগ্র সত্তা, এই জগত-**সেই** চৈতন্যেই আলোকিত। তোমার প্রতিটি স্বপ্ন, প্রতিটি নীরবতা, প্রতিটি সচেতন মুহূর্ত, প্রতিটি অভিজ্ঞতা-সবই _তার_ প্রমাণ। এমনকি “আমি কি ব্রহ্মকে অভিজ্ঞ করতে পারি?”-এই প্রশ্নটিও _তার_ আলোর মধ্যেই উদয় হয়। যেমন সাগর ও ঢেউ আসলে জল ছাড়া আর কিছু নয়, তেমনি তুমি ও শক্তি-ব্রহ্মেরই বহুরূপ প্রকাশ।

এটাই সেই অনচঞ্চল সত্য, যাকে মৃত্যু স্পর্শ করতে পারে না। দেহ মরবে, মন ও “আমি”-বোধ বিলীন হবে-কিন্তু তোমার **স্বরূপ** নিত্য। তা অনন্ত, অজ, অবিনশ্বর। যেমন [শ্রীকৃষ্ণ](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/index/) **ভগবদ্‌গীতায়** (২.১৭–২.২৫) ঘোষণা করেন-আত্মা অবিনশ্বর; অস্ত্র কাটতে পারে না, অগ্নি পোড়াতে পারে না, জল ভেজাতে পারে না, বায়ু শুকোতে পারে না।

> **avināśhi tu tadviddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam, vināśham avyayasyāsya na kaśhchit kartum arhati ॥** (2.17)

>
> **avyakto ’yam achintyo ’yam avikāryo ’yam uchyate, tasmādevaṁ viditvainaṁ nānuśhochitum arhasi ॥** (2.25)

অতএব-**তুমি শক্তি**, তবে ক্ষমতাকে নিজের বলে ‘অধিকার’ করার অহংকারে নয়।

> তুমি শক্তিকে “রেখে” বা “ধরে” রাখো না; **তুমিই** শক্তি-অস্থায়ীভাবে এই দেহে অবস্থান করলেও, এর দ্বারা কখনও সীমাবদ্ধ নও।

যখন এই বোধ উদিত হয়, সব তুলনা গলে যায়। “আমি” আর “অন্য” বলে কিছু থাকে না; সর্বত্রই মাকে দেখ-একই অনন্ত, চিরজাগ্রত চৈতন্য প্রত্যেকটি রূপে দীপ্যমান। তখন উপলব্ধি হয়: **চিদানন্দরূপঃ শিবোহম্ শিবোহম্**, যেমন সুন্দরভাবে গাওয়া হয়েছে [নির্বাণ ষটকে](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed_RsCvuPBQ&list=RDEd_RsCvuPBQ&start_radio=1)।


# উপসংহার
এভাবেই যাত্রা সম্পূর্ণ হয়। বাহিরে *তাঁকে* পূজা করা থেকে, অন্তরে *তাঁকে* খুঁজে পাওয়া, শেষে *তাঁতেই* লয় হওয়া। মা আনন্দময়ী-সদা-আনন্দ, সদা-প্রকাশ। তুমি যে রূপে দেখতে প্রস্তুত, সেই রূপেই তিনি ধরা দেন। আর যদি সত্যিই তাঁকে চাও, তিনি তোমার আকাঙ্ক্ষারই রূপ ধারণ করবেন। যেমন ঠাকুর বলেছেন, “যত মত, তত পথ।” সত্যিই, প্রতিটি হৃদয়ের মা-র পথে চলার আলাদা পথ আছে, এবং প্রতিটি জীবনে তিনি নিজেকে আলাদা ভঙ্গিতে প্রকাশ করেন।

কিন্তু এখানেই আসল দুঃখ। উৎসবের দিনগুলি পেরোলে আমরা *তাঁকে* ভুলে যাই। “জীবন” আবার দৌড়ে ফিরে আসে-কাজ, পরিবার, ডেডলাইন, দায়িত্ব। আমরা আবার ব্যস্ত হয়ে পড়ি: বিজ্ঞান, প্রগতি, সাফল্যের পিছু ধাওয়া; ইন্দ্রিয়সুখে মন সমর্পণ; যাকে “রিয়াল লাইফ” বলি, সেটার অজুহাতে দর্শন-চিন্তাকে নিছক তত্ত্ব মনে করে চায়ের আড্ডার (আন্টলামী) কথা-বাস্তবে বাঁচা নয়। সেই ব্যস্ততায় মা মনের এক ভুলে-যাওয়া কোণে চাপা স্মৃতি হয়ে থাকেন।

*তাঁকে* সত্যিই আবার পেতে হলে, অন্তত এক মুহূর্তের জন্যও এই জাগতিক খেলনা-ভেলকি সরিয়ে রেখে ফিরিয়ে আনতে হবে সেই আকুলতা-সেই পবিত্র **ব্যাকুলতা**। যেমন ঠাকুর বলেছেন, খেলনা ফেলে রেখে শিশুর মতো মাকে ডাকতে হবে; যে শিশুকে কিছুতেই শান্ত করা যায় না-মা ছাড়া, প্রিয় খেলনাতেও নয়। ওই ব্যাকুলতা না থাকলে আমরা ক্ষণস্থায়ী জগতে ক্ষণিক সুখেই সন্তুষ্ট হয়ে থাকি-কখনো সত্যিকারের সুখী হই না। চারদিকে তাকাও-পাও কি এমন একজনকে, যে বলে, “হ্যাঁ, আমার জীবন সম্পূর্ণ সুখের; আর কিছু চাই না, আর কোনো সাফল্য, স্বাচ্ছন্দ্য বা সুখের প্রয়োজন নেই”?

কিন্তু যেই মায়ের জন্য সেই তৃষ্ণা জেগে ওঠে-এক মুহূর্তের জন্যও-তখনই বুঝতে পারো, *তাঁকে* কোনোদিন হারাওনি। *তিনি* তো সব সময়ই ছিলেন-তোমার নিঃশ্বাসে, তোমার দৃষ্টিতে, তোমার সুখ-দুঃখে, তোমার অন্তরের নীরব চৈতন্যে-**জ্যোতিরও জ্যোতি**।
