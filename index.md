# Who is Maa Kali?

Being the first of the ten [Mahavidyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavidya), [Maa Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali) is the epitome of [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti). _Her_ iconography depicts _Her_ as "ugra" (fierce) - Dark as the darkest [Kartik Amavasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavasya) night sky, with three wide-open eyes that see past time, long tangled hair, a lolling crimson tongue, and wearing a garland of countless skulls symbolizing the passing of time - numerous births and deaths (Kaal). _She_ stands on [Lord Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), in the cremation ground (samshan). In _Her_ left hands, she holds a severed head and a kharga (scimitar), symbols of the destruction of [Ahamkara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahamkara) (the ego or the “I” consciousness) and [Avidya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Hinduism)) (ignorance). In _Her_ right, _She_ blesses and grants boons through the [Abhaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhayamudra) and [Varada mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadamudra).
Despite this fierce iconography, we love and adore _Her_ in our own ways. For example, my sister, looking at our community's (para) Kali idol (murti), exclaimed, "Maa ke khub cute dekhte lagche" (translation: Maa looks so cute). That's the magic of Kali - terrifying yet tender, destructive yet deeply loving.

_But who really is Maa Kali? What does she signify? **How can we see Her as Thakur Sri Ramakrishna saw Her?**_
Let's take a journey together — to see Maa as the Mother, as Power, as the Primordial Energy, and as the Self within. Each reveals a different facet of the same truth. Understanding each, we discover that how we see Maa depends on our Bhava — the inner feeling with which we approach Her.

### Bhava 1: Kali as the Divine Mother {#aspect-1}
<!-- paste your Aspect 1 text here -->
At this level, Shakti appears in the form of Maa Kali, Maa Durga, Maa Saraswati, or any motherly power we worship. _She_ is external to us, our divine protector, our guide, our nurturer. We call out to _Her_ as we would to our earthly mother. Sometimes in love, sometimes in fear, but always in faith. _She_ destroys evil and removes obstacles, yet her destruction is compassionate, which clears the path for light to enter. _She_ blesses those who walk the path of [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), and gently corrects those who stray. Understanding _Her_ in this way is [Bhakti Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), the path of devotion. Here, the devotee and the Divine are two separate beings bound by love. It's a relationship of sweetness, surrender, and emotion - a [_Rasa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(theology)) (flavour) that fills the heart with bliss.


### Bhava 2: Kali as Shakti - The Power of Shiva {#aspect-2}
<!-- paste your Aspect 2 text here -->
At a deeper level, Maa Kali is not merely someone outside who blesses us; _She_ is the very Power of the Absolute (Shiva). _She_ is Shiva's ardhangini - _His_ other half, _His_ pulse. Without _Her_, Shiva is _sava_ - motionless, pure stillness without expression. _She_ is _His_ expressive power, the one who makes consciousness move. As mentioned in the 6th mantra of the [Devi Sukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta) ([Ṛgveda: X.125](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)):

> ahaṃ rudrāya dhanurā tanomi brahmadviṣe śarave hantavā u, ahaṃ janāya samadaṃ kṛṇomy-ahaṃ dyāvā-pṛthivī āviveśa ॥ 6
>
> _(Meaning: I bend the bow for Rudra to slay the demonic enemies of the noble. I battle the enemies of my devotees. Indeed, I pervade heaven and earth.)_

This is [Tantric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra) [non-duality philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism) (Shiva-Shakti tattva philosophy), where Shiva is pure, unchanging consciousness (Cit), and Shakti is the vibration, the movement (Spanda) of that consciousness. Together they form existence itself - the stillness and the dance. When Maa Kali dances, the universe comes alive; when _She_ stops, everything returns to stillness. Every breath, every heartbeat, every flash of thought is her movement within the vast silence of Shiva. In the Kali Tantra and Sakta texts, this union is described as a constant embrace, where Shiva, lying below, symbolizes the silent foundation of awareness, while Kali, standing upon _Him_, symbolizes energy rising and playing upon that awareness. When we recognize this, the image of Kali standing on Shiva is no longer "violent" but profoundly symbolic: consciousness and energy - two names for one Reality, forever entwined.


### Bhava 3: Kali as the Primordial Power that Flows through Us {#aspect-3}
<!-- paste your Aspect 3 text here -->
At this level, Kali is no longer just an external goddess or even the power of Shiva. _She_ is the primordial pulse that keeps the universe alive. Shakti is the unseen rhythm of existence, the force by which the unmanifest becomes manifest. The rising sun, the beating of your heart, the birth and death of stars - all dance to _Her_ rhythm. The same energy that spins galaxies also hums within your spine as [Prana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana). Every thought that flashes across your mind, every surge of emotion, every act of creation or destruction - all are movements of Shakti. _She_ is the power that makes perception possible, the background vibration that turns pure consciousness into experience. When you feel inspired, when you love deeply, when you suffer and still rise again - that's _Her_ too. Shakti is not "out there"; _She_ is the current that flows through everything that is. According to [Samkhya Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya), _She_ is Mūla-Prakṛti, the first cause. In [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), _She_ is [Maya-Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Hinduism), the dynamic nature of [Nirguna Brahman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrf6pbk/revision/2) - pure stillness appearing as motion. Kali is that very motion - timeless energy taking form as time itself. As mentioned in the 4th and 8th mantras of the Devi Sukta (Ṛgveda: X.125):
> mayā so annam-atti yo vipaśyati yaḥ prāṇiti ya īṃ śṛṇotyuktam, amantavo māṃ ta upa kṣiyanti śrudhi-śruta śraddhivaṃ te vadāmi ॥ 4
>
>_(Meaning: He who eats food, sees, breathes, and hears that is spoken, does so through me. Those who are ignorant of me perish. You, who have ears, listen — I tell you that which is deserving of Śraddhā.)_
>
> aham-eva vāta-iva pra vāmy-ārabhamāṇā bhuvanāni viśvā, paro divā para enā pṛthivyaitāvatī mahinā saṃ babhūva ॥ 8
>
> _(Meaning: Like the wind that blows, I set in motion all the created things. I am beyond the sky and the earth and I have become all this, in my own splendour.)_


### Bhava 4: Kali as Your Inner Being {#aspect-4}
<!-- paste your Aspect 4 text here -->
Now come close. Ask yourself the question **"Who am I?"** Are you the body? The mind? If so, then point me to where in the body "you" reside? You might point towards your head and say, _"Here, in the brain"_. But, if I take an MRI of your brain, will I find you sitting there? No, right? The body is a tool, an instrument. The atma is subtler.

Then maybe you will say, _"I am the mind - my thoughts, feelings, memories"_. But think again. In deep sleep, the mind goes silent, and yet you remain! You wake and say, "I slept well". Someone clearly witnessed even that blankness. Or perhaps you will say, _"I am the social roles I play - as a parent, a child, a doctor, a friend, etc."_ - an idea which resonates among many cognitive scientists. But roles change every day. The daughter becomes a mother, the student becomes a teacher, the employee becomes the boss. Your knowledge, emotions, preferences, even your opinions, evolve with time - yet something constant watches it all. Who keeps track of all these changes? Who says, "I was different before"? That quiet witness - that awareness which notes change - is the real you.

Let's understand it deeper. If you observe the mind carefully in meditation, you will see thoughts rise and fall, emotions come and go, and even the feeling of "I" fades and returns. During moments of deep focus, such as reading, painting, or even watching a film, you forget time, body, and surroundings. Yet afterward, you know you were absorbed. That knowing is proof of the silent Witness - the [Sakshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakshi_(witness)) that never sleeps. This Witness has no shape, no boundary, no birth. It is pure Awareness - [Sat-Cit-Ananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccid%C4%81nanda), the essence of [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). At this level, Shiva and Shakti merge. Stillness and movement, energy and consciousness, they are not two - they are Advaita. Like wave and ocean, they differ only in name and form (nama and rupa).

**What is Brahman?**

Brahman is not a "cosmic thing". _It_ cannot be objectified, because _It_ is the very ground of knowing. Our language inevitably treats _It_ as an object, but _It_ is that by which even language shines. That's why the sages used the method of ["Neti Neti"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_neti) (not this, not that) to point beyond words. Whatever you can describe is already within the light of Brahman. As [Swami Sarvapriyananda](https://www.vedantany.org/introductory-lectures) beautifully says, _"The subject can never be the object of experience"_. It's like [Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) in spiritual form: within any system, there are truths that the system itself cannot prove. Likewise, within this finite body-mind system, we can't "know" Brahman as an object - because Brahman is the subject and this body-mind system is the object.

You might dejectedly wonder, **"Then can I never experience Brahman?"**

The paradox is, you already are experiencing _It_, always. Because, as the [Chandogya Upanishad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandogya_Upanishad) mentions, you are _It_. [**Tat tvam asi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas) — You are That. Just as you infer the presence of light from the objects it reveals, you can infer Brahman from the very fact that you see, think, and feel. Objects in a room are not visible in the absence of light. Hence, seeing the objects is evidence of the presence of the illuminating light. Similarly, this entire existence is lit by That Consciousness. Every dream, every silence, every moment of awareness, every experience of yours is _Its_ evidence. Even the question "Can I experience Brahman?" arises within _Its_ light. Just like the ocean and its waves are nothing but water, you and Shakti are nothing but manifestations of Brahman.

This is the unchanging truth that death cannot touch. Your body will die, your mind and the sense of "I" will dissolve, but your Swarupa (your true essence) is eternal. It is infinite, unborn, and deathless. As Sri Krishna declares in the [Bhagavad Gita](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/index/):

> avināśhi tu tadviddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam, vināśham avyayasyāsya na kaśhchit kartum arhati ॥
> 
> antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śharīriṇaḥ, anāśhino ’prameyasya tasmād yudhyasva bhārata ॥
> 
> ya enaṁ vetti hantāraṁ yaśh chainaṁ manyate hatam, ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate ॥
> 
> na jāyate mriyate vā kadāchin, nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ, ajo nityaḥ śhāśhvato ’yaṁ purāṇo, na hanyate hanyamāne śharīre ॥ (2.17-2.20)
>
> _(Meaning: That which pervades the entire body, know it to be indestructible. No one can cause the destruction of the imperishable soul. Only the material body is perishable; the embodied soul within is indestructible, immeasurable, and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendent of Bharat. Neither of them is in knowledge-the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed. The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.)_
> 
>
> nainaṁ chhindanti śhastrāṇi nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ, na chainaṁ kledayantyāpo na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ ॥ 2.23 _(Meaning: Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it.)_
>
> achchhedyo ’yam adāhyo ’yam akledyo ’śhoṣhya eva cha, nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇur achalo ’yaṁ sanātanaḥ ॥ 2.24 _(Meaning: The soul is unbreakable and incombustible; it can neither be dampened nor dried. It is everlasting, in all places, unalterable, immutable, and primordial.)_
>
> avyakto ’yam achintyo ’yam avikāryo ’yam uchyate, tasmādevaṁ viditvainaṁ nānuśhochitum arhasi ॥ 2.25 _(Meaning: The soul is spoken of as invisible, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.)_


So yes - **you are Shakti**, but not in the egoic sense of possessing power.
> You don't "have" Shakti; you are Shakti — localized for a while in this body, yet never limited by it.

When that insight dawns, all comparison dissolves. You no longer see "yourself" and "others"; you see Maa everywhere — the same infinite, ever-living consciousness shining as every form. You realize **Chidanada roopah Shivoham Shivoham!**, as nicely sung in [Nirvana Shatakam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed_RsCvuPBQ&list=RDEd_RsCvuPBQ&start_radio=1)

### Conclusion
And thus, the journey completes. From worshipping _Her_ outside, to finding _Her_ within, to finally dissolving as _Her_. It's alright if we can't always "find" the Mother. She is Anondomoyee - ever-blissful, ever-revealing. She appears in whatever form you are ready to see. And if you truly long for Her, She will take the shape of your longing. As Thakur said, "Joto mot, toto poth" (As many faiths, so many paths). Truly, each heart has its own path to the Mother, and She expresses _Herself_ in each life in a unique way.

But here lies the real difficulty. Once the days of the festival pass, we tend to forget _Her_. We get busy again, caught up in work, family, and endless routines. Busy chasing science, progress, and success. Busy offering our minds to the pleasures of the senses. Busy living the real life and shunning the philosophical aspect of life as if it is something only to be discussed over a cup of tea (aantlami). And in that busyness, the Mother becomes a faint memory, relegated to a quiet corner of the heart. To truly find _Her_ again, we must drop these toys of worldly life for a moment and bring back that yearning - that sacred restlessness (byakulata). As Thakur said, we have to shun our toys and only seek Maa, just like a child calls for their Mother and nothing else can pacify them other than their Mother. Not even their favorite toys. Without that, we remain content with the fleeting pleasures of a fleeting world and are never truly happy in life. Look around you. Can you find one person who says _"Yes, I a happy in life and I do not want anything else from it - I am content with all I have, and I don't want any more material pleasures that the world has to offer"?_ But when that yearning for the Mother awakens, even for a moment, you will see that Mother was never gone. She was there all along, in your breath, in your gaze, in your happiness and sadness, in that silent awareness within you.
