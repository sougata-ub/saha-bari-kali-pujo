# Maa er dorshon
## What is Shakti? This question can be answered at five levels of darshan.

### Level 1: Shakti as the external goddess
Shakti, in the form of Maa Kali, Maa Durga, or any other motherly power we worship, and is external to us. This is the devotional or iconic aspect, where Shakti is perceived as a divine being outside oneself - the energy that powers the universe and its beings. Worshipping Shakti in this murti form is the essence of Bhakti yoga, where the devotee and the Divine are two. This experience is full of rasa - it’s sweet, devotional, and emotionally beautiful.

### Level 2: Shakti as the power of the goddess
Shakti as Shiva’s ardhangini and His expressive power. She creates, sustains, and destroys. Without Her, even Shiva cannot act. This is the mythic-theological level, where we understand that Shakti and Shiva are two poles of one reality. It reflects Tantric non-duality (Shiva-Shakti tattva): Shiva is pure consciousness (cit), Shakti is the movement of that consciousness (spanda).

### Level 3: Shakti as the primordial power
It is the primordial power that makes things happen. Shakti is the unseen pulse of existence - the power by which the unmanifest becomes manifest. The rising sun, the beating heart, the birth and death of stars - all are Shakti’s rhythms. Even the thought that comes to your mind, the pain and pleasures in life, all our emotions, the force that turns galaxies, whatever we do or think of doing, the entire essence of existence, as the way we perceive, using our minds, is due to shakti. This corresponds to the cosmological or metaphysical level, identifying Shakti as the fundamental energy underlying all phenomena, and aligns with Samkhya philosophy and Advaita Vedanta’s Maya Shakti - the dynamic nature of Nirguna Brahman. This is deep. But still does not capture the entire picture.

### Level 4: Shakti as your inner being
Ask yourself, “Who am I?”
Are you the body? If so, where do you exist inside it? If you scan the brain, will you find ‘you’?
Are you the mind? Then, when the mind is silent in sleep, where are you?

Ask yourself the question “Who am I?” Are you the body? The mind? If so, then point me to where in the body “you” reside? You might point towards your head and say, “Here, in the brain”. But, if I take an MRI of your brain, will I find you sitting there? No, right? The body is a tool, an instrument. The atma is subtler.

Then maybe you’ll say, “I am the mind, the thoughts, the emotions.”
But see, in deep sleep, the mind shuts down, yet you exist.
You wake and say, “I slept well.” That means someone witnessed even that absence.

Or perhaps you’ll say, “I am my social roles - parent, child, doctor, friend”. This idea of defining the self as the sum total of one’s social roles is held by many cognitive scientists.
However, if you think deeper, roles change every day. The one who was a student becomes a teacher, the daughter becomes a mother, the employee becomes the boss - everything moves, everything shifts. If “you” were only those roles, then you would have been lost. We say that we change with time. For example, our preferences, maturity, etc. But observe that there is someone who is witnessing this change. Otherwise, how would you know that you have changed? So, who is keeping track of all these? Is that the real you? If you think deeply, you are nothing but a continuous stream of experiences. At each moment, you are experiencing something. Even a moment is an experience. Even you reading this article is an experience. And each experience is a wave of Shakti passing through consciousness. Just as the evidence of light is the visibility of the objects in a room, the evidence of Shakti is your living experience itself.
If there were no Shakti, you couldn’t feel, think, breathe, or even doubt.
The thought “Who am I?” itself is Shakti’s play - the self turning its gaze inward.

She breathes as you, speaks as you, loves as you, and cries as you.
She becomes the pulse in your chest, the tremor before a decision, the silence after a deep prayer.

So ask yourself, “Am I Shakti?”
Yes, but be careful. Don’t say it with ahamkar (ego), as if we possess the power to move the universe. You do not possess Shakti. Instead, you are Shakti - condensed, embodied, localized for a while in this body. When you truly see that, all comparison dissolves, and you see Maa everywhere.

In Tantric terms, this is the awakening of iccha-shakti (will), jnana-shakti (knowledge), and kriya-shakti (action) inside the microcosm. The same cosmic energy that spins galaxies is spinning within your spine as prana. This is the moment when the external worship becomes antar-yoga - inward adoration.

### Level 5: Shakti as the Absolute Self
There is yet one thing that remains unanswered. You said, “I am experiencing”. Then ask, who is experiencing this experience? If all experiences are waves of Shakti, then who is the witness of these waves? Aha! Now you have got to the meat of things. 

Close your eyes and watch. Thoughts rise and fall, emotions come and go, even the sense of “I” comes and goes. But something remains unchanged - the silent witness, the Sakshi. That witness is not a thing; it has no form, no boundary, no birth. It is pure awareness - Śiva-tattva itself. At this point, the divide between Shiva and Shakti disappears. Movement and stillness, energy and consciousness, they are not two; they are one seamless Reality. Just like the wave realizes it was never separate from the ocean. It is water that manifests both as the wave and the ocean. Similarly, Shakti and Brahman are not different substances; they are different ways of looking at the same limitless Consciousness. Brahman is not a cosmic “stuff” or a divine “thing.” It is that which cannot be objectified, because It is the very ground of knowing. That’s why the sages say “Neti Neti” - not this, not that - because whatever you point to is already within It.
Now, you might ask, “Can I ever experience Brahman?” The paradox is that you are always experiencing It, because you are It. Every perception, every dream, every silence is Its evidence. Just as in a dream, the “dream you” is proof of the real you who sleeps, so this waking world is proof of Brahman who simply is. 
So when the Upaniṣads declare “Brahma satya jagat mithya”, it doesn’t mean the world is false. It means the world is the appearance of the Real, like a dream is the appearance of the dreamer. You, me, all this around us (Samsara) is the dream of Brahman. And yet, Brahman never ceases to be the dreamer even while dreaming. That’s why the sages said “Tat tvam asi” - “You are That”. The same infinite, unborn, never-dying consciousness that shines as the universe shines also as you.

And thus, the journey completes. From worshipping Her outside, to finding Her within, to finally dissolving as Her. It’s alright if we can’t always “find” the Mother. She is Anondomoyee - ever-blissful, ever-revealing. She appears in whatever form you are ready to see. And if you truly long for Her, She will take the shape of your longing. As Thakur said, “Joto mot, toto poth” - “As many faiths, so many paths.” Truly, each heart has its own path to the Mother, and She expresses Herself in each life in a unique way.
But here lies the real difficulty. Once the days of the festival pass, we tend to forget Her. We get busy again, caught up in work, family, and endless routines. Busy chasing science, progress, and success. Busy offering our minds to the pleasures of the senses. Busy living the real life and shunning the philosophical aspect of life as if it is something only to be discussed over a cup of tea (aantlami). And in that busyness, the Mother becomes a faint memory, relegated to a quiet corner of the heart. To truly find Her again, we must drop these toys of worldly life for a moment and bring back that yearning - that sacred restlessness (byakulata). As Thakur said, we have to shun our toys and only seek Maa, just like a child calls for their Mother and nothing else can pacify them other than their Mom. Not even their favorite toys. Without that, we remain content with the fleeting pleasures of a fleeting world and are never truly happy in life. Look around you. Can you find one person who says “Yes, I a happy in life and I do not want anything else from it. I am content with all that I have, and I don’t want what I don’t.” But when that yearning awakens, even for a moment, you will see that Mother was never gone. She was there all along, in your breath, in your gaze, in your happiness and sadness, in that silent awareness within you.
