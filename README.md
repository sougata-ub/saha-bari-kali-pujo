# Darshon e Maa er dorshon
Being the first of the ten [Mahavidyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavidya), [Maa Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali) is the epitome of [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti). Her iconography depicts her as "ugra" (fierce) - Dark as the darkest [Kartik Amavasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavasya) night sky, with three wide-open eyes that see past time, long tangled hair, a lolling crimson tongue, and wearing a garland of countless skulls symbolizing the passing of time - numerous births asnd deaths (Kala). She stands on [Lord Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva), in the cremation ground (samshan). In her left hands, she holds a severed head and a kharga (scimitar), symbols of the destruction of [Ahamkara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahamkara) (the ego or the “I” consciousness) and [Avidya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Hinduism)) (ignorance). In her right, she blesses and grants boons through the [Abhaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhayamudra) and [Varada mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadamudra).
Despite this fierce iconography, we love and adore her in our own ways. For example, my sister, looking at our community’s (para) Kali idol (murti), exclaimed, "Maa ke khub cute dekhte lagche" (translation: Maa looks so cute). That's the magic of Kali - terrifying yet tender, destructive yet deeply loving.

#### But who really is Maa Kali? What does she signify? 
To answer that, let's look at a few aspects, each revealing a different truth, depending on what resonates within us.

### Aspect 1: Kali as the Divine Mother
At this level, Shakti appears in the form of Maa Kali, Maa Durga, Maa Saraswati, or any motherly power we worship. She is external to us, our divine protector, our guide, our nurturer. We call out to her as we would to our earthly mother. Sometimes in love, sometimes in fear, but always in faith. She destroys evil and removes obstacles, yet her destruction is compassionate, which clears the path for light to enter. She blesses those who walk the path of [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), and gently corrects those who stray. Understanding her in this way is [Bhakti Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), the path of devotion. Here, the devotee and the Divine are two separate beings bound by love. It's a relationship of sweetness, surrender, and emotion - a [_Rasa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(theology)) (flavour) that fills the heart with bliss.


### Aspect 2: Kali as Shakti - The Power of Shiva
At a deeper level, Maa Kali is not merely someone outside who blesses us; she is the very Power of the Absolute (Shiva). She is Shiva's ardhangini - his other half, his pulse. Without Her, Shiva is _sava_ - motionless, pure stillness without expression. She is his expressive power, the one who makes consciousness move. As mentioned in the 6th mantra of the [Devi Sukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta) ([Ṛgveda: X.125](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)):

> ahaṃ rudrāya dhanurā tanomi brahmadviṣe śarave hantavā u | ahaṃ janāya samadaṃ kṛṇomy-ahaṃ dyāvā-pṛthivī āviveśa ॥ 6
>
>_(Meaning: I bend the bow for Rudra to slay the demonic enemies of the noble. I battle the enemies of my devotees. Indeed, I pervade heaven and earth.)_

This is [Tantric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra) [non-duality philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism) (Shiva-Shakti tattva philosophy), where Shiva is pure, unchanging consciousness (Cit), and Shakti is the vibration, the movement (Spanda) of that consciousness. Together they form existence itself - the stillness and the dance. When Maa Kali dances, the universe comes alive; when she stops, everything returns to stillness. Every breath, every heartbeat, every flash of thought is her movement within the vast silence of Shiva. In the Kali Tantra and Sakta texts, this union is described as a constant embrace, where Shiva, lying below, symbolizes the silent foundation of awareness, while Kali, standing upon him, symbolizes energy rising and playing upon that awareness. When we recognize this, the image of Kali standing on Shiva is no longer "violent" but profoundly symbolic: consciousness and energy - two names for one Reality, forever entwined.

### Aspect 3: Kali as the Primordial Power that Flows through Us
At this level, Kali is no longer just an external goddess or even the power of Shiva. She is the primordial pulse that keeps the universe alive. Shakti is the unseen rhythm of existence, the force by which the unmanifest becomes manifest. The rising sun, the beating of your heart, the birth and death of stars - all dance to Her rhythm. The same energy that spins galaxies also hums within your spine as [Prana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana). Every thought that flashes across your mind, every surge of emotion, every act of creation or destruction - all are movements of Shakti. She is the power that makes perception possible, the background vibration that turns pure consciousness into experience. When you feel inspired, when you love deeply, when you suffer and still rise again - that's Her too. Shakti is not "out there"; She's the current that flows through everything that is. According to [Samkhya Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya), She is Mūla-Prakṛti, the first cause. In [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), She is [Maya-Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Hinduism), the dynamic nature of [Nirguna Brahman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrf6pbk/revision/2) - pure stillness appearing as motion. Kali is that very motion - timeless energy taking form as time itself. As mentioned in the 4th and 8th mantras of the Devi Sukta (Ṛgveda: X.125):
> mayā so annam-atti yo vipaśyati yaḥ prāṇiti ya īṃ śṛṇotyuktam | amantavo māṃ ta upa kṣiyanti śrudhi-śruta śraddhivaṃ te vadāmi ॥ 4
>
>_(Meaning: He who eats food, sees, breathes, and hears that is spoken, does so through me. Those who are ignorant of me perish. You, who have ears, listen — I tell you that which is deserving of Śraddhā.)_

> aham-eva vāta-iva pra vāmy-ārabhamāṇā bhuvanāni viśvā | paro divā para enā pṛthivyaitāvatī mahinā saṃ babhūva ॥ 8
>
> _(Meaning: Like the wind that blows, I set in motion all the created things. I am beyond the sky and the earth and I have become all this, in my own splendour.)_


### Aspect 4: Kali as Your Inner Being
Ask yourself, “Who am I?”
Are you the body? If so, where do you exist inside it? If you scan the brain, will you find ‘you’?
Are you the mind? Then, when the mind is silent in sleep, where are you?

Ask yourself the question “Who am I?” Are you the body? The mind? If so, then point me to where in the body “you” reside? You might point towards your head and say, “Here, in the brain”. But, if I take an MRI of your brain, will I find you sitting there? No, right? The body is a tool, an instrument. The atma is subtler.

Then maybe you’ll say, “I am the mind, the thoughts, the emotions.”
But see, in deep sleep, the mind shuts down, yet you exist.
You wake and say, “I slept well.” That means someone witnessed even that absence.

Or perhaps you’ll say, “I am my social roles - parent, child, doctor, friend”. This idea of defining the self as the sum total of one’s social roles is held by many cognitive scientists.
However, if you think deeper, roles change every day. The one who was a student becomes a teacher, the daughter becomes a mother, the employee becomes the boss - everything moves, everything shifts. If “you” were only those roles, then you would have been lost. We say that we change with time. For example, our preferences, maturity, etc. But observe that there is someone who is witnessing this change. Otherwise, how would you know that you have changed? So, who is keeping track of all these? Is that the real you? If you think deeply, you are nothing but a continuous stream of experiences. At each moment, you are experiencing something. Even a moment is an experience. Even you reading this article is an experience. And each experience is a wave of Shakti passing through consciousness. Just as the evidence of light is the visibility of the objects in a room, the evidence of Shakti is your living experience itself.
If there were no Shakti, you couldn’t feel, think, breathe, or even doubt.
The thought “Who am I?” itself is Shakti’s play - the self turning its gaze inward.

She breathes as you, speaks as you, loves as you, and cries as you.
She becomes the pulse in your chest, the tremor before a decision, the silence after a deep prayer.

So ask yourself, “Am I Shakti?”
Yes, but be careful. Don’t say it with ahamkar (ego), as if we possess the power to move the universe. You do not possess Shakti. Instead, you are Shakti - condensed, embodied, localized for a while in this body. When you truly see that, all comparison dissolves, and you see Maa everywhere.

In Tantric terms, this is the awakening of iccha-shakti (will), jnana-shakti (knowledge), and kriya-shakti (action) inside the microcosm. The same cosmic energy that spins galaxies is spinning within your spine as prana. This is the moment when the external worship becomes antar-yoga - inward adoration.

### Level 5: Shakti as the Absolute Self
There is yet one thing that remains unanswered. You said, “I am experiencing”. Then ask, who is experiencing this experience? If all experiences are waves of Shakti, then who is the witness of these waves? Aha! Now you have got to the meat of things. 

Close your eyes and watch. Thoughts rise and fall, emotions come and go, even the sense of “I” comes and goes. But something remains unchanged - the silent witness, the Sakshi. That witness is not a thing; it has no form, no boundary, no birth. It is pure awareness - Śiva-tattva itself. At this point, the divide between Shiva and Shakti disappears. Movement and stillness, energy and consciousness, they are not two; they are one seamless Reality. Just like the wave realizes it was never separate from the ocean. It is water that manifests both as the wave and the ocean. Similarly, Shakti and Brahman are not different substances; they are different ways of looking at the same limitless Consciousness. Brahman is not a cosmic “stuff” or a divine “thing.” It is that which cannot be objectified, because It is the very ground of knowing. That’s why the sages say “Neti Neti” - not this, not that - because whatever you point to is already within It.
Now, you might ask, “Can I ever experience Brahman?” The paradox is that you are always experiencing It, because you are It. Every perception, every dream, every silence is Its evidence. Just as in a dream, the “dream you” is proof of the real you who sleeps, so this waking world is proof of Brahman who simply is. 
So when the Upaniṣads declare “Brahma satya jagat mithya”, it doesn’t mean the world is false. It means the world is the appearance of the Real, like a dream is the appearance of the dreamer. You, me, all this around us (Samsara) is the dream of Brahman. And yet, Brahman never ceases to be the dreamer even while dreaming. That’s why the sages said “Tat tvam asi” - “You are That”. The same infinite, unborn, never-dying consciousness that shines as the universe shines also as you.

And thus, the journey completes. From worshipping Her outside, to finding Her within, to finally dissolving as Her. It’s alright if we can’t always “find” the Mother. She is Anondomoyee - ever-blissful, ever-revealing. She appears in whatever form you are ready to see. And if you truly long for Her, She will take the shape of your longing. As Thakur said, “Joto mot, toto poth” - “As many faiths, so many paths.” Truly, each heart has its own path to the Mother, and She expresses Herself in each life in a unique way.
But here lies the real difficulty. Once the days of the festival pass, we tend to forget Her. We get busy again, caught up in work, family, and endless routines. Busy chasing science, progress, and success. Busy offering our minds to the pleasures of the senses. Busy living the real life and shunning the philosophical aspect of life as if it is something only to be discussed over a cup of tea (aantlami). And in that busyness, the Mother becomes a faint memory, relegated to a quiet corner of the heart. To truly find Her again, we must drop these toys of worldly life for a moment and bring back that yearning - that sacred restlessness (byakulata). As Thakur said, we have to shun our toys and only seek Maa, just like a child calls for their Mother and nothing else can pacify them other than their Mom. Not even their favorite toys. Without that, we remain content with the fleeting pleasures of a fleeting world and are never truly happy in life. Look around you. Can you find one person who says “Yes, I a happy in life and I do not want anything else from it. I am content with all that I have, and I don’t want what I don’t.” But when that yearning awakens, even for a moment, you will see that Mother was never gone. She was there all along, in your breath, in your gaze, in your happiness and sadness, in that silent awareness within you.
